# 🔒 The Hideout Economy

## 📘 Overview
The Hideout Economy is a **tiered, progression-based system** designed to control gear flow, promote risk vs reward gameplay, and encourage PvP, events, and raiding.  
Safezones provide stability and mid-tier access, while **endgame power is locked behind Black Market access, events, and high-risk activities**.

- [x] Black Market = power & risk

- [x] Raiding is the only source of certain items  
- [x] Economy discourages hoarding & early endgame

# 🎁 Drop Tables per Event Type

## 📘 Core Philosophy
- Safezones provide **no event drops**
- Events drive **gear progression**
- Black Market remains the **endgame endpoint**
- No single event drops everything
- T4 armor and .338 never come from low-risk events
