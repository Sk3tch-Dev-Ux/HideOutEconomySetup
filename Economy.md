# A6 Balanced Loot System  
### Major Progression & Economy Update

This update introduces a **fully redesigned, tier-based loot system** for all A6 weapons and supporting equipment.  
The goal is to create **clear progression**, **fair engagements**, and **meaningful high-end loot**, while eliminating early-game power spikes and late-game meta abuse.

---

## What’s New

### ✔ Tier-Based Loot Progression
All weapons, magazines, ammunition, optics, and attachments are now organized into **five distinct tiers** based on power and availability.

This ensures:
- Early survival gear is accessible
- Military hardware requires exploration
- End-game weapons feel rare and earned

---

## Tier Overview

### Tier 1 – Civilian (Common)
**Where:** Towns, villages, farms, hunting locations  

- Basic pistols and civilian rifles
- Civilian pistol magazines
- Common 9×19 ammunition
- Basic hunting optics

**What this means:**  
You’ll always be able to arm yourself early, but without overwhelming firepower.

---

### Tier 2 – Police (Uncommon)
**Where:** Police stations (limited military overlap)

- Police pistols and entry-level SMGs
- Police-grade magazines
- Police calibers (5.7×28, 4.6×30, .50 AE)
- Red dot and holo sights

**What this means:**  
Police locations now act as a true **mid-game bridge** between civilian and military gear.

---

### Tier 3 – Military (Rare)
**Where:** Military bases and installations

- Standard military assault rifles
- Military SMGs and marksman rifles
- Standard military magazines
- Core rifle ammunition (5.45, 5.56, 7.62×54R)
- Military optics and tactical attachments

**What this means:**  
Military areas are your primary source for combat-ready gear — but not end-game dominance.

---

### Tier 4 – Elite Military (Very Rare)
**Where:** High-tier military zones

- Battle rifles and elite SMGs
- Suppressed weapons
- Precision rifles
- Extended and elite magazines
- Advanced optics and suppressors

**What this means:**  
These items are powerful, rare, and intentionally difficult to acquire.

---

### Tier 5 – Legendary
**Where:** Contaminated zones, helicopter crashes, Tier-4 military areas

- .50 caliber sniper rifles
- Heavy LMGs
- LMG belts and anti-materiel ammunition
- Top-tier sniper optics
- Legendary suppressors

**What this means:**  
These weapons define the end-game and are **never common**.

---

## Ammunition Rebalance

Ammunition now follows the same tier structure as weapons:
- Common ammo is widely available
- Military ammo is restricted to military zones
- Exotic and anti-materiel rounds are end-game only

This prevents high-power weapons from being sustained too easily.

---

## Optics & Attachments

- Basic optics appear early and often
- Military-grade optics require military travel
- Precision and sniper optics are restricted to high-tier zones
- Suppressors are intentionally rare
- Large-caliber suppressors are legendary only

---

## Balance Philosophy

### Fair Progression
- Civilian → Police → Military → Elite → Legendary
- Power increases with risk and exploration

### Anti-Meta Design
- LMGs are legendary tier only
- Suppressed weapons are rare by design
- High-capacity magazines require effort

### Economy Stability
- Controlled spawn counts
- Timed restock cycles
- No early-wipe dominance

---

## What This Means for Players

- Loot progression feels natural and rewarding
- High-end gear is valuable again
- PvP encounters are more balanced
- Exploration and map knowledge matter

This update lays the foundation for a **long-term, healthy loot economy**.
